Your Current Traffic Flows:
â€¢  Frontend â†’ Auth/Items/Discounts services (API calls)
â€¢  Auth/Items/Discounts â†’ MongoDB (database queries)
â€¢  Prometheus â†’ All pods (metrics scraping)
â€¢  Ingress Controller â†’ Frontend/Grafana/Prometheus services
â€¢  DNS queries from all pods â†’ kube-dns



Analysis: Your Current Security Setup

What you ALREADY have with AWS VPC CNI + Security Groups:

âœ… Traffic is locked down at the node level:
â€¢  Protocol -1 (all traffic) allowed only within 10.0.0.0/16 VPC CIDR
â€¢  Specific ports (443, 6443, etc.) for cluster management
â€¢  This effectively isolates your microservices from external traffic

âœ… Only ingress exposed publicly:
â€¢  Your LoadBalancer is the only public entry point
â€¢  All backend services are ClusterIP (internal only)

âœ… VPC-level network segmentation:
â€¢  All pod-to-pod traffic stays within the private VPC
â€¢  External access requires going through the LoadBalancer


Pod-Level Security with AWS VPC CNI:

AWS VPC CNI + Security Groups:
â€¢  Node-level security (all pods on a node share the same security group)
â€¢  Cannot isolate pod-to-pod traffic within the same node
â€¢  Example: Your auth and items pods on the same node can freely communicate

Kubernetes without NetworkPolicy support:
â€¢  Service-level isolation (ClusterIP vs LoadBalancer)
â€¢  Namespace-level isolation (basic)
â€¢  But no fine-grained pod-to-pod controls

With Calico/Cilium:
â€¢  True pod-level security (each pod can have different rules)
â€¢  Can block auth â†’ items even on same node
â€¢  Much more granular control

For Your Use Case:

Current security is sufficient because:
â€¢  Your microservices should be able to talk to each other
â€¢  External access is properly controlled via ingress
â€¢  Node-level isolation protects against external threats

You'd need pod-level security if:
â€¢  You had untrusted workloads in the same cluster
â€¢  Regulatory compliance required micro-segmentation
â€¢  You wanted defense-in-depth against compromised pods



ðŸŽ¯ What You've Built
You have successfully created a production-grade microservices platform with:

â€¢  âœ… React frontend client
â€¢  âœ… Complete local development setup with HAProxy
â€¢  âœ… Full containerization with Docker
â€¢  âœ… Kubernetes deployment on EKS (via Terraform)
â€¢  âœ… Automated CI/CD pipeline
â€¢  âœ… Comprehensive monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana
â€¢  âœ… Centralized logging
â€¢  âœ… SSL/TLS certificates via cert-manager
â€¢  âœ… Complete documentation
